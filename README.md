MAppFx is a web page interactive map environment that retrieves an interactive graph of a site upon clickin on a map feature object (be it a point, polygon, or a line). WERI Web MAppFx is a product of WERI through the Guam Hydrologic Survey Program (GU P.L. 24-247) and USGS 104-b, available through the [Guam Hydrologic Survey website](https://guamhydrologicsurvey.uog.edu/). MAppFx is developed by the GHS Information Management Team: Dannika K. U. Valerio, Matt W. Zapata, Leroy F. Heitz, and Nathan C. Habana in collaboration with Brigham Young University Civil Engineering Department: Riley Hales, Gus Williams, and Norm Jones.

This map is based on a GHS data analysis of Guam's production well nitrate samples completed by Jezreelyn Y. Bulaklak and Nathan Habana. A [Scientific Advisory Report](https://www.postguam.com/news/local/study-nitrate-levels-rising-in-water-wells/article_030ad950-27a5-11eb-b457-275e19ec9e17.html) was produced and written by Jezreelyn Bulaklak, Nathan Habana, and John Jenson. 

Data originated from Guam Waterworks Authority as organized and transferred through Mauryn McDonald ([WERI Technical Report 95](https://weri-cdn.uog.edu/wp-content/PDFs/TRs/WERI%20TR%2095%20-%20McDonald%202002.pdf)), and lab records from Jennifer Cruz, N'tasha Perez, Carmen Sian-Denton, and Gary Denton.
